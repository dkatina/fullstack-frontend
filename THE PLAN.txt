The Idea - Linktree for Musicians

West Main social media hub + announcements

User Stories:

MVP (Minimum Viable Product - Agile)
    User View:

    Users will click on a link and be brought to a landing page with West Main's social media outlets and spotify and apple music page links

    Additionally they will be able to see recent releases and upcoming projects.

    Could be directly routed to songs on either spotify or apple music

    Admin View:

    In addition to whats mentioned about.

    Basic project CRUD

    What is a project?:
        - Single/ Song
        - EP
        - Album

    Songs can be apart of an EP or an Album, or they can be a standalone single.
    So need to be able to assign songs if need be.

    Be able to contact the artist, contact page

PHASE 2:
    Automate the uploading of projects

    When you add the song to spotify, it automatically populates in the releases

PHASE 3:
    Tour Dates and CRUD for that

PHASE 4:
    Merch and Ecom extension

PHASE 5:
    email notifications both ways,
